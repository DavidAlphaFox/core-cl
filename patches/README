This is a set of patches, mainly for windows, that fix things that are broken.

For instance, Node-gyp forces you to use the windows stack to build things,
however node.js doesn't build on the windows stack. The node.h patch is applied
to ~/.node-gyp/v0.xx.x/src/node.h to fix the build.

Also, on windows, usocket doesn't like to build in ECL. The included patch makes
it take the MinGW32 system into account (and not depend on a number of Windows
headers that MinGW abtracts away).
